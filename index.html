        <h1>Credit Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic</h1>
        <h2>How is your community faring on credit health measures?</h2>
        <p class="date-line">Last updated March XX, 2022</p>
      </div>
      <div class="small-well intro">


        <p>
          The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted people’s lives across the United States. To understand how the pandemic and the economic response influenced credit health—people’s credit scores, debt delinquencies, and borrowing—we examined credit bureau data from February 2020 to August 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key measures of credit health have improved since February 2020, but many families and communities still face financial challenges. Racial disparities in credit health reflect historical inequities that reduced wealth and limited economic choices for communities of color.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trends since February 2020 indicate that policymakers’ and private-sector partners’ actions to help families weather the financial impacts of the pandemic have made a difference. However, credit indicators in August 2021 show that many families still face barriers to financial health. Additional supports are necessary to sustain improvements and help struggling families.
        </p>
        <div id="median-credit-and-race" class="inline-chart right">
          <h3>Median credit scores reveal persistent racial disparities</h3>

          <ul class="us-legend"><li class="nationall"><div class="legend-dash"></div>All Communities</li><li class="nationblack"><div class="legend-dash"></div>Black</li><li class="nationhisp"><div class="legend-dash"></div>Hispanic</li><li class="nationnative"><div class="legend-dash"></div>Native&nbsp;American</li><li class="nationwhite"><div class="legend-dash"></div>White</li></ul>
          <div id="median-credit-and-race-chart"></div>
          <p class='chart-note'><b>Source:</b> Tabulations of Urban Institute credit bureau data.<br><b>Notes:</b> Credit scores are Vantage scores that range from 300 to 850. The communities listed in the key refer to zip codes where more than 60 percent of residents are Native American or in the respective racial or ethnic group.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Credit plays a vital role in families’ abilities to weather financial disruption and access assets and education, but it does not tell the full story of financial health. Credit data cannot capture the experiences of about 1 in 10 US adults who do not have a credit file, a disproportionate amount of whom are people of color. And although credit health appears to have improved for all groups during the pandemic, racial gaps have not narrowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Majority-Black communities and majority–Native American communities have the lowest median credit scores and the highest debt-in-collection rates, subprime credit score rates, and use of high-cost payday and other nonbank loans. These racial disparities reflect historical inequities that reduced wealth and limited economic choices for communities of color.
        </p>

        <p>Our data dashboard provides a timeline of these and other measures to show how the pandemic has affected residents’ credit health at the county, state, and national levels. How are the residents of your state or county faring?

          Several credit health measures improved during the pandemic, but many families and communities still face financial challenges.

            <li><b>Credit scores improved, and the typical score is now prime for residents living in majority-Black and majority–Native American communities.</b> The median credit score for all adults with a credit record was 709 in August 2021, compared with a median credit score of 693 in February 2020. About 1 in 5 (20 percent) adults with a credit record had a subprime credit score in August 2021. This improved from February, when 25 percent had a subprime credit score. Notably, the median credit score for residents living in majority-Black and majority–Native American communities improved nearly 30 points since the beginning of the pandemic and brought the median credit score into the prime range. More residents <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-cost-poor-credit">may benefit from lower borrowing costs</a> and have more options in the event that they need credit.</li>
            <li><b>A smaller share of residents carried past-due debt.</b> About 28 percent of adults with a credit record had debt in collections in August 2021, a slight decline from February 2020 when about 30 percent had debt in collections. The share of borrowers with past-due debt declined for those borrowing student loans, credit card debt, auto and retail loans, and mortgages.</li>
            <li><b>Alternative financial services loan (e.g., payday loan) use shows signs of financial hardship.</b> In February 2021, 4.9 percent of adults with a credit file had used alternative financial service loans like payday loans, an increase from 4.4 percent in February 2020. About 9.5 percent of people with alternative financial services loans were 30 or more days delinquent in February 2021, compared with 11.5 percent in February 2020. </li>
            <li><b>Racial disparities in credit health reflect historical inequities that reduced wealth and limited economic choices for communities of color.</b> The credit health of major demographic groups improved during the pandemic, but gaps have not narrowed. Majority-Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities experience rates of subprime credit scores, debt in collections, and high-cost nonbank borrowing at least 1.5 times higher than rates in majority-white communities.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4 class="takeaways"><b>Policy options</b></h4>
        <p class="first">
          COVID-19 created financial challenges for families across the US. Federal, state, and local policymakers responded with supports to help families weather the pandemic’s economic fallout. State governments play a significant role in distributing federal resources, filling gaps in the federal response, and enacting consumer protection regulations.

        <h4 class="takeaways"><b>What is credit health?</b></h4>
        <p class="first">
          Credit scores affect people’s ability to borrow, influencing their ability to buy a home or car or pay for emergency expenses. Credit can be vital to families who need to smooth their expenses until the next paycheck or pay for an emergency expenditure like a medical visit or car repair. Without access to credit—and preferably prime credit—many Americans with low incomes are stymied on their path to success.
        </p>
        <p>
          The financial cost is high for the 22 percent of Americans in the credit system who have subprime credit. When they seek to borrow, people with subprime credit scores often only qualify for loans with the highest interest rates. And debt payments may take up a large share of their income. Borrowers with <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-cost-poor-credit">subprime credit scores</a> can pay nearly $400 more in interest for a $550 emergency loan over three months and $3,000 more in interest for a $10,000 used-car loan over four years compared with borrowers with prime credit scores.

      <p class="first">
        This dashboard contains information derived from a 2 percent nationally representative panel of deidentified, consumer-level records from a major credit bureau from February 2020 to February 2021 and includes data on more than 5 million consumers for this period. We enriched the panel with an additional 2 percent sample of consumer-level records in August 2021 to better characterize the credit health of consumers in less populated areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        We augment the data from February 2020 to February 2021 with information on alternative financial service loans from the consumers in our panel from a Fair Credit Reporting Act regulated agency whose unique data source is derived from various financial service providers. These providers include online small-dollar lenders; online installment lenders; storefront small-dollar lenders; and single payment, line of credit, auto title, and rent-to-own lenders.
      </p>

      <p>The credit bureau data do not include information about race, so the racial and ethnic community metrics are based on the racial makeup of zip codes within the geographic area (US, state, county). We also incorporate zip code–level racial composition estimates from summary tables of the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (2014–18).
      </p>

      <p>Specifically, communities of color are based on credit records for people who live in zip codes where more than 60 percent of residents are people of color (Black, Hispanic, Asian American or Pacific Islander, Native American, another race other than white, or multiracial). In the same way, majority-white, Black, Hispanic, and Native communities are zip codes where more than 60 percent of residents are in the respective racial or ethnic group.
      </p>

      <p>We do not provide statistics on Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and other racial and ethnic communities because only a small number of zip codes in the US have more than 60 percent of residents identified as these respective racial or ethnic groups.</p>
