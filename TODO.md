# TO DO list

### tooltip
- When a new geography is selected (a new county, i.e.), the y position of the tooltip doesn't update
- It takes the largest data point from all the lines and that's how it positions the tooltip in y. It should calculate the largest value for every month and reposition the tooltip according to that. [Example](https://apps-staging.urban.org/features/tmp/uk-debt-updates/032022-update/uk-financial-vulnerability-index/)

### no data
It seems like it only identifies no data at a county level.
